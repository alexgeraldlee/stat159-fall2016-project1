#Conclusion

Reproducibility is the hallmark of a complete study: if the results cannot
be reproduced, the conclusions of that study should be disregarded until
further research supports it. To that end, researchers need to support the
reproducibility of their own work by utilizing the various tools available
to them. Make is a tool that allows users (and others) to run the exact same
shell commands every single time, no matter how many, without error; this
allows other researchers to reproduce the shell commands, which are often
hidden because they are not typically considered "code". Git is a tool that
handles version control of the project, facilitating the storage and retrieval
of various versions of the project. GitHub, an online extension of Git, gives
the benefits of Git to various collaborators and provides a public history of 
the project's versions for outside researchers to access. Pandoc is a tool
that facilitates file conversion, allowing the same information to be 
transmitted to many different platforms and programs, which is particularly
helpful when other researchers have downloaded research documents in an
effort to replicate the research. Markdown is a tool that allows a simple
conversion from plain text to formatted HTML, allowing researchers to more
easily upload their reports to the internet without having to know all the
HTML scripts. This report should 
serve not only as an overview of the uses and importance of these tools, but also
as a basic tutorial on how to use them in reproducible research; anyone should be
able to refer to this report as a guide to learn or re-learn how to integrate these
tools into their own research. Each of these tools plays an important role in the sharing of documents and
data, and for the goal of reproducible research as a whole, and it is vital
that new and old researchers alike integrate these tools into their research methodology
and forge a new era where research can be replicated and checked for validity by all.
