#Conclusion

Reproducibility is the hallmark of a complete study: if the results cannot
be reproduced, the conclusions of that study should be disregarded until
further research supports it. To that end, researchers need to support the
reproducibility of their own work by utilizing the various tools available
to them. Make is a tool that allows users (and others) to run the exact same
shell commands every single time, no matter how many, without error; this
allows other researchers to reproduce the shell commands, which are often
hidden because they are not typically considered "code". Git is a tool that
handles version control of the project, facilitating the storage and retrieval
of various versions of the project. GitHub, an online extension of Git, gives
the benefits of Git to various collaborators and provides a public history of 
the project's versions for outside researchers to access.
