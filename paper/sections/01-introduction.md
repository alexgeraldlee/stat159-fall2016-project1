#Introduction

The inability to reproduce work is a severe roadblock in the way of scientific
study. In a world where scientific research is often taken, not only by the 
laypeople but also by politicians and organizational leaders, as gospel when it
comes to making decisions for themselves or for others, it is the responsibility
of the researchers to ensure not only that their own studies are correct, but also 
that other researchers can verify their correctness and that they verify the
research that others publish. To that end, it is important that researchers
employ the tools at their disposal for making their research, methodology, and
data as public and as compatible with other machines as possible. This report
will look at five of these tools - Make, Git, GitHub, pandoc, and Markdown - and
address their function, how to use them at a rudimentary level, why they are
important for the reproducible workflow, and how they address the current lack of
reproducible research in the world today.
