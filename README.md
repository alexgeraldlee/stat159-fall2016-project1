##Project Structure

The final structure of the project should look something like this:

stat159-fall2016-project1/

	.gitignore

	README.md

	Makefile

	paper/

		sections/

			00-abstract.md

			01-introduction.md

			02-discussion.md

			03-conclusions.md

		paper.md

		paper.html

	images/

		git-logo.png

		github-logo.png

		markdown-logo.png

		pandoc-logo.png

		stat159-logo.png

##The Makefile

The Makefile is used to construct paper.md and paper.html, by compiling the .md files in sections/ using pandoc. The Makefile also holds a script "clean" that can be called to remove the .html file.
